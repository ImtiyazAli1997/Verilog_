Q] today tomorrow date problem

design a circuit which takes input as today's date and give's tomorrow's date as output.

we have an input x which decides the number of days x=1 then its 31 days if x=0 its 30 days

ALSO GENERATE AN OUTPUT ERR WHEN INPUT IS ZERO and when today input is greater than the number of days in the month [which is illegal input]


note:	sizes for inputs can be decided by u

example input today take 1 to 30 so 5 bits binary
output tomorrow take 2 to 30 so 5 bit again

outp err 1 bit
