Q] today tomorrow date problem

design a circuit which takes input as today's date and give's tomorrow's date as output.
assume each moonth to be 30 days

ALSO GENERATE AN OUTPUT ERR WHEN INPUT IS ZERO OR 31

note:	sizes for inputs can be decided by u

example input todat take 1 to 30 so 5 bits binary
output tomorrow take 2 to 30 so 5 bit again

outp err 1 bit
